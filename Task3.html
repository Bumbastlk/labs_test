                        (PCs) and attempt to overcome those challenges. Danger comes in the form of monsters, <Br>
                        devious traps, and the machinations of adversarial agents, but Pathfinder also provides<br>
                        political schemes, puzzles, interpersonal drama, and much, much more.</td>

                    <td>Pathfinder is played in sessions, during which players gather in person or online for a few <br>
                        hours to play the game. A complete Pathfinder story can be as short as a single session,<br>
                        commonly referred to as a “one-shot,” or it can stretch on for multiple sessions, forming<br>
                        a campaign that might last for months or even years. If the Game Master enjoys telling<br>
                        the story and the players are entertained, the game can go as long as you like.<br>
                        A session can be mostly action, with battles with vile beasts, escapes from fiendish<br>
                        traps, and the completion of heroic quests. Alternatively, it could include negotiating with<br>
                        a baron for rights to a fort, infiltrating an army of lumbering frost giants, or bargaining<br>
                        with an angel for a strand of hair required for an elixir to revive a slain friend. Ultimately<br>
                        it’s up to you and your group to determine what kind of game you are playing, from<br>
                        dungeon exploration to a nuanced political drama, or anything in between.</td>
